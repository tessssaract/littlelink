# LittleLink

The homepage for [tessaract.gay](https://tessaract.gay) built using [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink). It links to my social media, content creation, and various profiles I use as a competitive Splatoon player and streamer.

### Changes
Various formatting changes including a footer with credits, custom colors, and resized elements.

Custom buttons for the following services:
- sendou.ink
- pronouns.cc
- stat.ink
- YouTube (dark theme)
- BlueMap
- Broadcast Box

### Deployment
My site is automatically built from the latest commit with Vercel, and LittleLink's developer has an [excellent guide](https://youtu.be/mzI770VPIDw) demonstrating the process. My homepage is not friendly to forking as I've removed irrelevant CSS, but still feel free to build off it.
